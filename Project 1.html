    <p>The computers that everyone knows today weren’t as simple as the ones
        fifty to sixty years ago. Years ago, computers were used differently;
        from an ENIAC( Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) that could
        only solve numerical problems to a multi-functional computer; the technological
        industry has evolved rapidly like no other.
        Apple and Microsoft companies have been the two dominating, and commonly known
        software companies since they were first started.</p>
    <p>Apple was founded by three partners: Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne on
        April 1st, 1976. Jobs and Wozniak debuted their prototype of the Apple I at their
        Homebrew Computer Club; the Apple I was a circuit-board designed by Wozniak, and explained
        in a manual by Wayne. It came with expandable 4k RAM and a display of 60.05 Hz (“Apple I” para. 2 ).
        Steve Jobs took charge of advertising the product by promoting to friends and family. A few years later,
        the group released the Apple II with a ram of 4k-48k, a stunning display of 280 X 192, with a price ranging
        from $1298-$2638. This was the first computer to have a color display in the late 1970’s. </p>
